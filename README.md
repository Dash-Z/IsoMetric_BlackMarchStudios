# Isometric Level Example
This was made as a part of an Assignment for Black March Studios internship recuitment process. 
This project comprises of an Isometric Level environment made in Unity Engine to fulfill the following assignment requirements.

# Assignment 1
I created a block generator that generates an Isometric platform using Cubes and arranges them in a 10x10 grid in the scene.
The block position is displayed at the bottom of the screen whenever the player hovers their mouse over the blocks.

# Assignment 2
I created an Editor Tool in Unity that is capable of assigning obstacles to the grid and spawn these obstacles when the grid is spawned.
The obstacles are represented in the form of Red Hemispheres placed on the blocks of the generated surface.
